Before starting my PhD, I did a master in computer science at <a href='https://www.ens-rennes.fr/'>École normale supérieure de Rennes</a>. I am now working on autonomous driving systems, fully commited to make cars safer. In particular, I am working on 3D perception, dynamic scene understanding and world models.
